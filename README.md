 We made this project when we participated Hack x SJTU competition.\
 Thanks NVIDIA for their technical support

#### Function Detail
We implemented a smart car using Arduino and TX1.
The smart car do some movement as following:
* Move forward when the camera detect a car
* Move Back when detect a chair
* Turn left when detect a cat
* Turn right when detect a person
* Turn left then move forward when detect a bird
* Turn right then move forward when detect a bicycle
* Stop immediatily when the car meet an obstacle(using ultrasonic sensor)

#### Techniques
* Caffe Deeplearning framework
* Arduino
* ROS
* OpenCV

#### Files
* car4.c is the code controlling arduino
* main.cpp is the code controlling TX1


#### Deployment
You should use ROS to create a function package named ros_caffe\
Then create a node named ros_caffe_test

#### Run
``` bash
  catkin_make
  roscore
  rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0
  rosrun ros_caffe ros_caffe_test

```
